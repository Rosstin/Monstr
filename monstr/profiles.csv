KNIFE FACTS:
1. There is a knife (the WASP knife) that once inside the victim, forces over 800 psi of CO2 inside the victim, creating a basketball-sized air pocket and freezing the surrounding internal organs!!

2. An elderly Eskimo in the 1950s, in order to escape government settlement made a knife out of his own feces & frozen spit, killed a dog with it and used its ribs and organs to make a sled, tied it to other dogs and rode off. (!!!)

3. Sumo referees carry a knife to show that they are willing to kill themselves if they make a bad call. They are serious!

I am a WW and I live my whole life by the moon so expect our fling to last no longer than 28 days before I move on mentally and emotionally. Jus tbeing honest with you. However I swear they will be the best damn 28 days of ure life so far :) ;)","You catch a glimpse of a SUPER FIT and, god, just REALLY ATTRACTIVE LOOKING guy with fading whisps of werewolf fur all over his face and hands. Must be coming down off the full moon, huh? He strides off down the street, sighing into his phone: 'Sorry, I said no strings attached, man. I meant it.'","}Hey hottie.
{I see from your profile that you’re looking for a long term thing. Is that right?
}Yeah I’m down for fun but I eventually want to settle down, you know?
{I don’t think it will work out with us because I only do one month relationships. Good luck out there!","}Hey there’s a new moon and I’m looking for roughly 27 days of fun.

Will you be the 1st one to unwrap me? ;) Anyone who can message me in hieroglyphics gets an extra 10 points in my book haha,"A tall woman swaddled in bandages alights gracefully from the bus. You catch a glimpse of her face-- it's covered in an exquisite, ancient death mask. Ahh! What a BEAUTY! This one belongs in a museum... YOUR museum. The museum that is... YOUR HEART.","}We should get together. Lots of women are attracted to my pharoahmones.
{No. Just no.","}I love your mask.
{Thanks! I’ve been wearing it for a really long time and I’ve forgotten what my face looks like.
}Hey were you the one from the bus stop at Barrington and National?
{Yeah that was me! I noticed you too. You’re cute :)
}Do you want to get coffee?
{I have never had coffee.
}Forming an opinion on coffee is an important step towards acclimatizing yourself to the modern age.
}Okay!
{Are you free on Wednesday at noon?

{Let’s meet at Nitro cafe. I’ll send you directions. Sound good?

It sucks when the guy who decides to assemble you out of many different human corpses and bring you to life with the power of heaven-sent electricity tries to control the terms of your relationship. :/ I want a partner who has their own independence and respects me. If this describes you, please get in touch!","A woman in an enormous graying wedding gown ducks her tower of coiled black-and-white hair through the bus door and thumps down onto the sidewalk. Her skin is a patchwork of different tones and complexions, stitched together with the tiniest, most delicate stitches. Gosh, she's good-looking! You hope for a second that she'll notice your worshipful gaze, but she storms down the sidewalk, barking into her phone, 'NO, I will NOT see him again! I am now a SINGLE WOMAN, GODDAMN IT.'","}Hey so you dated your creator?
{He made me to be his bride.
}That’s pretty gross. It feels a little bit like incest almost. 
}Sorry, that was a really weird thing to say.
{Please don’t contact me again.","}Hey how are you?
{I’m well! Thanks for asking. 
{The last guy to message me just said “hey girl you dtf?” I didn’t know what it meant so I googled it and then I blocked him.
}There are a lot of assholes on Monstr.
{And in life! Just because someone creates you doesn’t mean they own you.
}No one should own anyone.
{I agree!!
}Would you be interested in a cup of coffee?
{Sure. That would be nice. Do you know Nitro Cafe?
}Yeah
{Are you free Wednesday at 8am?
}I can wake up early!
{Great. I will see you there."

And I say 'slip out of those pants baby' and you slip out of the pants all sexily because you like this kind of slow undressing foreplay. and then I put on my robe and wizard hat... 'because look, I'm a sorcerer,' the goddamn Nature Sorcerer of the Forest of Sighs, I have to wear this fucking hat because I have a Strength deficit and the hat is +2 strength. Without it I can't even carry half the loot I get from these low-level chumps who come and try to beat on me all day long. I just want a partner who can come home and accept me for who I am, robe and all. Someone who doesn't mind if I wear the hat during sex (to maintain my endurance. It also has +1 END). If this is okay with you, get in touch, we'll see where things go. Peace","A short little guy in an enormous pointed hat and swirling sky-dark cloak hops down from the bus, trailing glittering streaks of lightning and storm-scent in his wake. And while visions of romantic embraces on tempest-wracked mountaintops flash through your mind, you spy a fascinating intensity in those eyes... an intensity in those wizardly eyes of his that you imagine would be QUITE HOT in the sack. QUITE HOT INDEED. Did he just cast a fire spell? Is it getting hot here? Phew!","}Hey little guy.
{Don’t call me that.
}Don’t worry, I know that big things can come in little packages.
{I’m the mightiest sorcerer of the lands.
}I’m sure you are.
{If you want I’ll cast Lvl. 3 Eroticism and turn you into someone beautiful.
}Hey… that’s hurtful.
{Okay fine I’ll make it Lvl. 5 Eroticism.","}I like your hat.
{Thanks. I’m the mightiest sorcerer of the lands.
}Oh yeah?
{Yep. The hat helps.
}By giving you endurance.
{It helps with all sorts of things.
}I think I saw you getting off of the bus the other day at Barrington and National.
{That was me. I saw you too. You’re pretty hot, baby.
}Want to get coffee?
{Sure. How’s 7pm on Tuesday at Nitro Cafe?
}Sounds great.

You smell loam, see bluebirds roosting on her wide and knotty shoulders... ahh! What a gorgeous girl! She hops the fence and wanders off into the park with a stately march.
