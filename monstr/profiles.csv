Favorite Knife: Butcher","I Am Not A Serial Killer.

KNIFE FACTS:
1. There is a knife (the WASP knife) that once inside the victim, forces over 800 psi of CO2 inside the victim, creating a basketball-sized air pocket and freezing the surrounding internal organs!!

2. An elderly Eskimo in the 1950s, in order to escape government settlement made a knife out of his own feces & frozen spit, killed a dog with it and used its ribs and organs to make a sled, tied it to other dogs and rode off. (!!!)

3. Sumo referees carry a knife to show that they are willing to kill themselves if they make a bad call. They are serious!
