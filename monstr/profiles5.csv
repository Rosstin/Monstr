I am a WW and I live my whole life by the moon so expect our fling to last no longer than 28 days before I move on mentally and emotionally. Jus tbeing honest with you. However I swear they will be the best damn 28 days of ure life so far :) ;)","You catch a glimpse of a SUPER FIT and, god, just REALLY ATTRACTIVE LOOKING guy with fading whisps of werewolf fur all over his face and hands. Must be coming down off the full moon, huh? He strides off down the street, sighing into his phone: 'Sorry, I said no strings attached, man. I meant it.'","hey how's it going this is the player

Race: patchwork","Hey guys, I recently broke up with my creator and I'm looking for relationship with someone who will accept me for the massive reanimated woman I am. It sucks when the guy who decides to assemble you out of many different human corpses and bring you to life with the power of heaven-sent electricity tries to control the terms of your relationship. :/ I want a partner who has their own independence and respects me. If this describes you, please get in touch!","A woman in an enormous graying wedding gown ducks her tower of coiled black-and-white hair through the bus door and thumps down onto the sidewalk. Her skin is a patchwork of different tones and complexions, stitched together with the tiniest, most delicate stitches. Gosh, she's good-looking! You hope for a second that she'll notice your worshipful gaze, but she storms down the sidewalk, barking into her phone, 'NO, I will NOT see him again! I am now a SINGLE WOMAN, GODDAMN IT.'","hey how's it going this is the player

You smell loam, see bluebirds roosting on her wide and knotty shoulders... ahh! What a gorgeous girl! She hops the fence and wanders off into the park with a stately march. Wow, she really pulls the whole 'is a tree' thing off, doesn't she??","hey how's it going this is the player
