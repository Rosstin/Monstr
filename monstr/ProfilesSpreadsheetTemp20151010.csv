Hair: Everywhere","I'm just a normal girl who is looking for someone to snuggle with in bed. My favorite TV show is The Wire That Connects My Brain To My Body because it was just super real. Please only message me if you're super real.

My fur is blue and sometimes I feel blue too. I hope that's okay.

The last guy I dated had 10 assholes, and that was appropriate because he was a total 10x asshole. I'm looking for someone who isn't an asshole. Preferably someone who doesn't even have an asshole, but I'm open.","A blue, furry figure cracks her neck in the sexiest way you've ever seen anyone crack her neck. She's your favorite shade of blue. She's the same shade of blue as your room when you just a kid monster. It feels like your whole life has been leading up to this point. She's your soulmate. You know it.","}Hey I don’t have an asshole.
{Excuse me? That’s a kinda personal thing to tell me in your first message.
}No it’s from your profile! That joke that you wrote.
{You literally have no asshole? How do you defecate?
}No I was joking...
{I don't think it's gonna work out.","}Hey I like your profile.
{I like yours too.
}Were you the one from the bus stop at Barrington and National?
{Yep, that was me. I thought you looked familiar :)
{You want to get coffee?
}Yeah!
}Do you know Nitro Cafe? Does sunday sound good?
{yeah I can do Sunday morning. 10 at Nitro?
}10 at nitro sounds perfect. See you there."

Magical Unicorn Horns: 1","Yeah that’s right, I’ve got a 19 year old unicorn’s hot bod with the wisdom and experience that comes from being a 249 year old unicorn ghost. And my horn is *MAGIC*. I like rainbows, night gardens, and long walks in the moonlight. 

I get a lot of offers, quite a few monster folks are looking for someone like me. So when you message me, please include the following:

- a photograph of yourself underneath your backyard waterfall at midnight (please make sure the lighting is NATURAL MOONLIGHT ONLY, no artificial lighting. You do have a backyard waterfall, right?)
- a 20-page detailed plan on how ghosts can be reintroduced to society 
- your clean health record, signed by a paranormal physician within the last 30 days (honestly I think everyone should do this, regardless of unicorn ghost status. just do it.)
- a 10 page “creative” sample on the importance and modern relevance of the rainbow (I will also accept an interpretive dance for this sample ONLY)

ALL MESSAGES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE ABOVE SUPPLEMENTS WILL BE IGNORED","A creature with four legs emerges, radiant and majestic. It appears to float, not walk off the bus. Is it sparkling in the sunlight, or is that… a rainbow? Regardless, you are entranced. You need to know more about this one…","}Hey whats up
{Where is your clean health record?
}Huh?
{Where is your creative work on the importance of the rainbow?
}I think it’s mostly important for lifting people’s spirits after a rainy day.
{Too little, too late.","}Hey I like your profile! I’ve uploaded all of the materials you requested as an attachment.
{Really??
}Yeah it was really fun to do actually. I have a lot of ghost friends and ghost suffrage means a lot to me.
{You... are the first person to actually send me all that stuff.
}Haha really?
{I am watching your dance about the rainbow and literally crying.
}Aww thanks.
{I think I love you.
}How about we start with coffee?
{Uh, yeah! That would probably be best.
}Do you know Nitro Cafe? Does Sunday sound good?
{Definitely. 10am Sunday at Nitro?
}10 at nitro sounds perfect.
{See you soon! Wear that shirt from your waterfall picture. It’s super hot."

Mane: Luscious","I'm a fucking centaur, baby. Haven't you always wanted to ride a centaur? Plus I'm RIPPED and my hair is long and beautiful. I'm not looking to settle down and have little horsemonster babies or anything, but who knows? Anything is possible.

What I am looking for is someone who wants to have fun. We can gallop through a meadow. I know a good meadow with lots of flowers and cool breezes that ripple through the grass.
","A four-legged creature with muscles that glisten in the sun. You want him so bad. He is super hot. You squirm in your chair. You bite your lip. You start to call out, but the bus is pulling away.","}Hey I’ve always wanted to ride a centaur.
{Hasn't everyone?
}Yep. I would ride you into the sunset. I would ride you until you couldn’t breathe. I would ride you until I broke you.
{Woah, woah. I’m not into all that stuff. No judgment. That’s just not me. Good luck out there.","}Hey I've always wanted to ride a centaur.

Favorite Anime: Haiyore! Nyaruko-san","I might have a huge head and I might have huge wings, but I promise that my heart is even bigger. Also, yes, my nipples are shaped like stars.

I am nearly fluent in Japanese. This is mostly because I’m planning on destroying a city over there next year — it’s been a lifelong dream of mine — and I figure that I’ll be way scarier if I can speak the language, you know?

I’m looking for someone who will be my partner in bed, my partner in life, and hopefully my partner in the destruction of Yatsushiro or some other small Japanese city.",His wings are green and leathery. His eyes are soft and goat-like. You think you see him glance back at you and you shrink away. He’s just…so…cute…,"}Hey I love your star nipples.
{Uh, thanks?
}Yeah they look really great and I want to lick them.
{Coming on a little strong there.
}Want to get coffee or something?
{Nah.","}Hey I have been studying Japanese too! Anata wa kawaidesu.
{Arigato :)
}Were you the one from the bus stop at Barrington and National?
{Yep, that was me. So that’s where I recognized you from!

Sleeping form: Gelatinous
","When I’m sleeping I’m a green gelatinous monster with dreamy blue eyes that never shut, but I have this incredible ability. I can transform into anything you want. This perfectly complements my favorite thing.

My favorite thing is making other people happy. So you tell me — what should I look like? Have you always wanted to date a perfect look-alike of yourself? I’m game. Maybe you dream of sitting across the table from Brad Pitviper. Why not?

No creepy stuff, though. I won’t pretend to be underage and I won’t pretend to be dead. I have nothing against the undead, it just feels really creepy when my skin gets cold and waxy.

I think that life is more interesting when it’s eclectic. For that reason, I’m not looking to settle down into a monogamous relationship. I will give you the best date or three of your life and then I will move on to making other monsters happy too.

So send me a message. Let me know what you want. I’ll let you know if that sounds fun. We’ll take it from there.",You can hardly believe your eyes. It’s Elizabeth Mosscreature. Right there in front of you. She catches your eyes. She winks at you. You can’t fucking breathe. And then you feel a wave of nausea as her skin begins to melt. A blur of motion and suddenly she’s James Frankostein. What? What is this? What the hell is going on? James Frankostein laughs at you as he walks away into the rain.,"}Hey what’s up.
{Not much. How’s it going?
}Pretty good. Your profile is really intriguing.
{So tell me. Who would you like me to be?
}This is gonna sound a little bit weird. But I’ve always wanted to date HP Lovecraft.
{What.
}He’s kinda my hero
{He was super racist and his face looked like smashed corn so that’s definitely not happening.","}So, this might sound weird, but were you the one from the bus who was Elizabeth Mosscreature and then transformed into James Frankostein?
{Hahaha yeah that was me. You were seriously freaked out.
}Yes I was. That was amazing. It made my day.
{You look pretty cute when you’re starstruck.
}Thanks :)
{Who’s your celebrity crush?
}Ummmmm... probably Amanda Seyfright?
{Fun! I’ve never done that one. How would you like to meet Amanda Seyfright for coffee and then see where it goes from there.
}That would be incredible.
{Do you know Nitro Cafe on National and Barrington? They’re open all night.
}Ya that place is great.
{How’s 10 pm Wednesday?
}Absolutely. I can’t wait.
{I will see you there. <3"
